## ðŸ“Š Tourism Arrivals and Expenditure for Selected Countries (2000â€“2020)

This report compares the trends in total international tourist arrivals and tourism expenditure between 2000 and 2020 for China, United States, United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Solid lines represent arrivals, while dashed lines show expenditure.

```{python}
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set visual style
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Load the datasets
arrival = pd.read_csv("Processed_data/arrival.csv")
expenditure = pd.read_csv("Processed_data/expenditure.csv")

# Ensure year is numeric
arrival["Years"] = arrival["Years"].astype(int)
expenditure["Years"] = expenditure["Years"].astype(int)

# Merge datasets on Country and Years
df = pd.merge(
    arrival[["Country", "Years", "Total arrivals (Thousands)"]],
    expenditure[["Country", "Years", "Tourism expenditure in the country (US$ Millions)"]],
    on=["Country", "Years"],
    how="inner"
)

# Filter for selected countries and year range
selected_countries = ['CHINA', 'UNITED STATES OF AMERICA', 'UNITED KINGDOM', 'FRANCE', 'SPAIN']
df = df[df["Country"].isin(selected_countries) & df["Years"].between(2000, 2020)]

# Scale the values for readability
df["Arrivals (Millions)"] = df["Total arrivals (Thousands)"] / 1000
df["Expenditure (Billions USD)"] = df["Tourism expenditure in the country (US$ Millions)"] / 1000

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

# Plot arrivals as solid lines
for country in selected_countries:
    data = df[df["Country"] == country]
    plt.plot(data["Years"], data["Arrivals (Millions)"], label=f"{country} - Arrivals", linestyle='-')

# Plot expenditure as dashed lines
for country in selected_countries:
    data = df[df["Country"] == country]
    plt.plot(data["Years"], data["Expenditure (Billions USD)"], label=f"{country} - Expenditure", linestyle='--')
